## Julie Natálie Smutná
Beginning designer. I started to do a graphic design on the college. 
It's the third year, now. 
On high school I tried to made some graphic collage from my artwork in Adobe photoshop.
In fact, I never do graphic design like that before. I'm opened to learn a new things. 
I have met with Adobe programs like Indesign, Illustrator, XD and so on.
I learned "How to make a magazine?" and "How I do a prototype of the application?". 
And sometimes I spend time with my new friends from school. I am friendly person.
We're did some school projects in the group.
