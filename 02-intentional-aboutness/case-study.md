### Meaning
#### It's about Artificial intelligence
I did a strong visual design. Inspiration I founded in rock called Pallasite. That create a background of main design. The first project inspired by cyborg. Adastra create and working with artificial intelligence, UX and UI design, comunication network, social media and so on. The cyborg to represent a comunication between people. The second project is the same theme but I drew a robot. The structure behind images is texture that created by computer inteligence. There used a RGB colours. This project is colourful at all.

#### It's about planets and space
This type of visual contents inspired by DeepDream from Google. It's type of creating by google picture. This type of creativity is consist of pictures from google pictures created by AI. Google gives a one of the picture and than it duplicate the part of them. And it had created unbelieveble structure from the parts of picture.

I used a same RGB colouring as similar as project before.
