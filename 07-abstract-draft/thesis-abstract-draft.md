# Grafic design and public space of the emerging metro D

<!-- Content goes here… -->
The main idea of my thesis is How could work visual element connect with grafic design in public spaces. Metro doesn't just a means of transport. It's a public space that you can see, waiting for metro and go.

I created a visual design for station Depo Písnice. Inspired by Dubai, Paris, Munich and many other contries. I described informatin and navigation system in Prague metro and comment it. Like logo, typography, warning sign and so on. In fisrt design I used materials that is very easy for cleaning, using and instalation. In second design has easy design too. But needed more materials and more approvals like fire situations etc. However, I spoke with specialist and he said that wouldn't be problem.
